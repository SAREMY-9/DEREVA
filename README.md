# Dereva
Dereva is a platform for driver test administration.
Prospective drivers are allowed to book for tests in advance prior to reporting to the test stations.
It incorporates various features on the user side such as:
logging in, user dashboard management, account management, test booking.
It includes the admin side where the features include:
test administration, results  uploading and test verifications.
The main aim of the project was to remove the traditional pen and paper 
model for driver test administration by digitization of the whole process.
